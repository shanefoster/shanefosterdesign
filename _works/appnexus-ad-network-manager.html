excerpt1: At AppNexus, our newly formed team in Portland was tasked with creating a new application intended to ease the mediation process for publishers. Our massive, enterprise <a href="https://console.appnexus.com/login">Console</a> product made this process extremely time consuming and difficult for our users. 
excerpt2: I was the lead designer for this project, which included all UX, Visual Design and Front-end HTML & CSS.

	<h2 class="Work-section">WHAT PROBLEM ARE WE TRYING TO SOLVE?</h2>
	<p><strong>How might we make it faster and easier to manage and optimize the mediation process when working with AppNexus?</strong></p>
	<p>Currently, the mobile mediation process can be extremely time consuming and difficult, especially within our massive, enterprise Console product.</p>

	<h2 class="Work-section">WHO ARE WE DESIGNING FOR?</h2>
	<p>Typically, the responsibility of managing the mediation process is handled by an entry to mid-level campaign or account manager. This is a tedious task that is often performed on a daily basis. It is very important to the business, but often dreaded by the responsible party, due it's manual process.</p>

	<h2 class="Work-section">MEASURES OF SUCCESS</h2>
	<p>The measures of success for this new feature will be: </p>

	<h2 class="Work-section">MY ROLE & RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>
	<p><strong>The Team</strong> – Product Manager, Product Designer (Me), Engineering Manager an Engineering Lead and five software engineers (front and back-end).</p>
	<blockquote>We were a remote office in Portland. I was the only designer working remotely. I was constantly collaborating with a design team of 9 in New York.</blockquote>
	<ul>
  		<li><strong>UX Design and Research</strong> – Responsible for research, usability testing and all other UX deliverables for the product.</li>
  		<li><strong>Visual Design</strong> – Created new theme and visual style for an AppNexus application, while still designing within our branding guidelines.</li>
  		<li><strong>Front-End</strong> – Established a front-end framework and owned all HTML/CSS for the application.</li>
  	</ul>

	<h2 class="Work-section">CURRENT APPROACH & PAIN POINTS</h2>
	
	<p>As mentioned above, users currently have to use our enterprise application for mediation, which is clunky and a very frustrating time-consuming process. <strong>The current navigation requires multiple clicks to access your creatives and campaigns that are embedded deep within each Line Item.</strong> Most of these steps were described as unnecessary for mediation.</p>
	
	<p>Moreover, searched was being described as difficult to decipher. These organizations can have hundreds of campaigns and creatives. Trying to quickly find what they are looking for with confidence can be quite difficult. <strong>Search would be key</strong>.</p>

	<h2 class="Work-section">ITERATIONS & SOLUTIONS</h2>

	<p>I took to my sketch pad to think about the information architecture that would solve these problems. It was imperative that the interactions focus on speed and discoverability of campaigns.</p>

	<p><strong>After multiple versions and user tests, we found that the most efficient solution for this specific problem was a Parent (Advertiser) to child relationship (Campaigns) that could be two levels deep</strong>. This eliminated a major issue in our enterprise application with the target campaign being nested multiple levels below the advertiser.</p>
	<p><strong>Moreover, allowing the user to expand each table row to edit the details of each campaign resulted in a major increase in speed</strong>. This was opposed to a hierarchical relationship where if a table campaign row was clicked, a user would access the details on a new child page.</p>

</div>

<div class="Container--text">
	<p>Lastly, this solution allowed for quick inline editing of key targeting information that the user updates the most often, CPM being the most crucial. <strong>Again, this change resulted in a major decrease in the time it took to update all campaigns for mediation.</strong></p>
</div>


<div class="Container--text">
	<h2 class="Work-section"> RESULTS</h2>
	<p>We were able to successfully decrease the time spent discovering target campaigns to be edited by more than 50%.</p>
	<p>The changes in IA also resulted in the steps to manually locate a campaign from 5 to 2.</p>

	<h2 class="Work-section">FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS</h2>
		<p>Expanding on search, users wanted the ability find groups of campaigns with specific attributes. <strong>We released a filtering system to allow them to better edit subsets of campaigns.</strong></p>

	<p><strong>Rather than forcing users to manually located campaigns that need to be optimized, we looked at ways to automate the process and provide more insights into their data.</strong> We received many feature requests for reporting, quick graphs and status updates for any campaigns that need addressing. The result of this work was the dashboard shown below.</p>
