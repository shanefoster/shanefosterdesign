excerpt1: I worked with one of our user researchers at AppNexus to put together a few one page documents to hang in our offices around the world. Each poster is a representation of real user painpoints that have been observered via user interviews, contextual inquiry and usability testing. The idea is to expose a few of these concepts to encourage everyone, across all teams, to empathize with our users.

excerpt2: It also aided in evangelizing UX within the organization.
