<h2 class="Work-section">UODT</h2>
<p><a href="http://uodance.com">UODance.com</a> is the official site of the University of Oregon Dance Team. The goal of the site is to help promote the team's upcoming events, clinics and social media channels. UODT is very active the social dance community, harnessing networks like Twitter, Facebook and Instagram to promote their team. Although the site provides the information needed for those seeking more information about tryouts or other UODT events, the goal is to expose the team's social properties to reach a broader audience using mediums they will more frequently visit. 
<p>I created the responsive site from the ground up using <a href="http://processwire.com">Processwire</a>. All UX, Visual Design and Front & Back-End coding is done by myself.</p>
