<p>Tango was created as a marketplace to more easily connect buyers and sellers within the AppNexus ecosystem. It allows for better partner discoverability and access to new relationships customers may have never been aware of before the system was put in place.</p>

<p>Tango was built from the ground-up within the AppNexus Console system. I acted as lead Visual Designer on the project, within the UX team. Because this was a new product within our framework, we'd be introducing many new layouts, features and components. I had to be sure our visual language and hierarchy stayed consistent with what had already been established. I acted as the bridge between UX and the front-end team to make this happen. In the end, we had a very successful product launch. You can see some of the mockups for the finished product below.</p>
