	<h2 class="Work-section">WHAT PROBLEM ARE WE TRYING TO SOLVE AND WHY?</h2>
	<p>Understanding one’s cloud spend and how to best optimize it can be very difficult to understand for many people.</p>
	<ul class="list--callout">
		<li style="border-left: solid 4px #0E95CC;">How might we help all users better understand their cloud spend?</li>
		<li style="border-left: solid 4px #0E95CC;">How might we help empower and educate our users?</li>
	</ul>

	<h2 class="Work-section">WHO ARE WE DESIGNING FOR & WHY?</h2>
	<p>Cloudability is a tool for power users. Not all users and accounts have access to a guided help and a Technical Account Manager. We want to improve the experience <strong>all</strong> users.</p>
	<p>
	<strong>When diving into our account and user data, we noticed a large increase in accounts below our volume threshold for TAMs</strong>. That is to say, we were actively onboarding a large number of new users that were not receiving any assistance after signing a contract.

	<h2 class="Work-section">MEASURES OF SUCCESS</h2>
	<p>The measures of success for this new feature will be: </p>
</div>

<div class="Grid u-">
	<div class="Grid-cell u-md-size1of3">
		<div class="box box--kpi">
			<h1>8 W</h1>
			<p>Release MVP of first Dashboard template from library in 8 weeks time.</p>
		</div>

	<h2 class="Work-section">CURRENT APPROACH & PAIN POINTS</h2>
	<p>Our current Dashboards require a lot of knowledge and work. The flexibility can be a negative in many cases. There are numerious options and choices. They are not ideal for all personas.
</div>

<div class="Container--text">
	<h2 class="Work-section">EXPLORATION</h2>
	<p>I really needed to identify the current pain points for new users exploring our platform on their own. How can we proactively help guide them?</p>
	<p>After multiple interviews, it became very clear that people without dedicated help needed another way to understand how to optimize their account.</p>
	<p>My initial exploration revoled around simplifying our current widget creation process, by making fewer controls and metrics to select. Is this easy enough for most users? It seemed it was not.</p>
</div>

<div class="Container--text">
	<h2 class="Work-section">USER TESTING & VALIDATION</h2>
	<p>We had certain KPIs on each page/section of the app. These can often be daunting to understand.</p>
    <p><strong>Would uncovering these on an initial dashboard with less information make them less intimidating to all users?</strong></p>
    <p>Although each section of the dashboard coudl be expanded and closed, it still felt overwhelming and difficult to navigate.</p>
    <p>However, there were some helpful callouts: Users seem to really understand the sankey diagram used.</p>

	<h2 class="Work-section">MORE EXPLORATION</h2>
	<p>A cloud cost optimization platform can be as technical as one may imagine, however, at the end of the day, it's all about finances.</p>
	<p><strong>Our users just want to know how much money they have saved, and where there are oppotunities to save more.</strong></p>
	<p>When you reframe it, what becomes important to show our users it becomes much more clear.</p>
	<p>This thinking led to the final version you see below, in which I:</p>

	<ul class="list--callout">
		<li style="border-left: solid 4px #0E95CC;">Simplified the data shown and made it as simple as possible to understand how you are performing, where you can save money and where you may need to take action</li>
		<li style="border-left: solid 4px #0E95CC;">Included the True Cost Explorer that many users said helped them really get a clear view of their overall spend.</li>	
	</ul>
</div>

<div class="Container--text">
	<h2 class="Work-section">EDUCATION</h2>
	<p>In order to continue to support our users and Educate and Empower (A Design Principle of ours) them, I designed a system that provides contextual help, based on where you are at in the application.</p>
	<p>This gives brings the wealth of learning materials we create to our users and doesn't force them to go find it. <strong>It also allowed us to track data around this help and better understand where are users may need more support.</strong> We can then act on this data and make future improvements.</p>
</div>

<div class="Container--text">
	<h2 class="Work-section">FOOTER</h2>
	<p>Our app didn't have a footer within the product. I saw this as another opportunity for us to help educate our users and make them aware of the many resources we offer to better help them understand how to optimize their cloud spend.</p>

	<h2 class="Work-section">RESULTS</h2>
	<p>The process took a bit longer than our anticipated goal, however, I feel the improvements we made to educate and empower our users we were the effort.</p>

	<h2 class="Work-section">FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS</h2>
	<p>Throughout the process, I worked very closely with our Technical Account Management team. They are the ones responsible for onboarding certain accounts. They broke this process down for me in detail.</p>
	<p>In the future we are hoping to offer a solution that automates this guided process for all users and allows their accounts to be in good health, right out of the gate.</p>
