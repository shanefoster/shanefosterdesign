excerpt1: Fantuition...oh, how I miss thee. Fantuition was an an online game that allowed people to attempt to predict the outcome of their favorite events, like sports or TV shows. Most current fantasy sports leagues require a huge time committment and a great deal of dedication. We aimed to offer quick, fun games for niche topics, that might appeal to a much wider audience.
excerpt2: This was a funded, bootstrapped startup. There were originally only three of us, therefore, we had to wear a lot of hats. I spent my time on UX, Visual Design and all Front-end code.

<p>Fantuition was an an online game that allowed people to attempt to predict the outcome of their favorite events, like sports or TV shows. Most current fantasy sports leagues require a huge time committment and a great deal of knowledge and dedication. We aimed to offer quick, fun games for niche topics, that might appeal to a much wider audience.</p>

<h2 class="Work-section">THE THREE AMIGOS</h2>
<p>Becuase we were a <a href="http://www.conversionrater.com/category/fantuition/">funded, bootstrapped startup of three</a>, we all wore many hats. My responsiblities spanned from defining our brand identity all the way to designing a responsive web app. While not designing campaigns and marketing materials for differnt social channels, I'd constantly be iterating on different user flows and features. I was lucky enough to work with two friends that valued design, specifically in the earliest stages of the product lifecycle.</p>
