excerpt1: Fantuition...oh, how I miss thee. Fantuition was an an online game that allowed people to attempt to predict the outcome of their favorite events, like sports or TV shows. Most current fantasy sports leagues require a huge time committment and a great deal of dedication. We aimed to offer quick, fun games for niche topics, that might appeal to a much wider audience.
excerpt2: This was a funded, bootstrapped startup. There were originally only three of us, therefore, we had to wear a lot of hats. I spent my time on UX, Visual Design and all Front-end code.
