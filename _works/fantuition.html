excerpt1: Fantuition was an an online game that allowed people to attempt to predict the outcome of their favorite events, like sports or TV shows. Most current fantasy sports games require a huge time commitment and a great deal of dedication. We aimed to offer quick, fun games for niche topics, that might appeal to a much wider audience.
excerpt2: This was a funded, bootstrapped startup. I was the lone designer on a small, agile team that featured a PM and a Lead Engineer and two other senior engineers. I spent my time on UX, Visual Design and all Front-end code.

	<h2 class="Work-section">WHAT PROBLEM ARE WE TRYING TO SOLVE AND WHY?</h2>
	<p>Most current fantasy sports games require a huge time commitment and a great deal of knowledge and dedication to be successful (even with that, I still manage to constantly lose. Go, me.). They require a deep knowledge of specific players, teams and topics, that are often of no interest to you.</p>
	<blockquote>How might we create a prediction game for fans that allows them to quickly compete <strong>but also keeps them engaged?</strong> </blockquote>


  <h2 class="Work-section">MY ROLE & RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>
  <p><strong>The Team</strong> – CEO, CTO, PM (Me) & three software engineers.</p>
  <ul>
  	<li><strong>Branding</strong> – Responsible for a complete redesign of the brand.</li>
  	<li><strong>UX Design and Research</strong> – Whether it was prototyping, wireframing, user testing, A/B tests or other UX processes, I was always in the mix.</li>
  	<li><strong>Visual Design</strong> – All visual design for the product (emails, marketing, iconography, typography, product UI, etc.).</li>
  	<li><strong>Front-End</strong> – Established a front-end framework and owned all HTML/CSS.</li>
  </ul>

	<h2 class="Work-section">WHO ARE WE DESIGNING FOR & WHY?</h2>
	<p>We initially targeted sports fans, specifically those already invested in fantasy sports. That transformed over time as we focused on entertainment categories.</p>
	<p>Fantasy sports are a multi-billion dollar industry in the US. We wanted to bring the thrill of playing these games to a larger market for everyone's enjoyment.</p>

  		  <h2 class="Work-section">CURRENT APPROACH & PAIN POINTS</h2>
		<p><strong>Branding Misalignment</strong> – As we continued building the product, talking to users and looking at the game data, we noticed games surrounding entertainment categories were gaining a lot of traction. Because of this, I had a goal to better align our identity with the product offering, which was games revolving around sports <strong>and</strong> entertainment. I transitioned from the muted color palette, to a brighter theme that portrayed "fun", across multiple categories, not just sports. <blockquote>We performed First Impression Tests on Usertesting.com to get an idea of how the design is perceived and what emotions it evokes.</blockquote></p>

<div class="Container--text">
	<p><strong>User Flow</strong> – I created a user flow to get a lay of the land. This allows me to see the whole picture and pinpoint areas that we could focus our efforts to meet our user and business goals.</p>
	<p>We were very focued on growing our userbase. I was looking for opportunites to create virality and social interactions.</p>

 <h2 class="Work-section">IMPROVEMENTS</h2>

<p>The product was beloved by many, and our userbase was constantly growing, but there were was much to be desired when it came to user engagment. Visitors were only visiting for a short period of time to play their game, then abandoning the app. We had a few ideas to fix this:</p>

</div>

	<div class="Callout">
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Mobile</strong> – How might we quickly build a mobile offering that allows users to access Fantuition from anywhere?</li>
			<li><strong>General Engagement</strong> – How might we encourage users to visit the app every day, as opposed to just the day of their scheduled event?</li>
			<li><strong>Social Interactions</strong> – How might we increase opportunities to share picks, awards and any other performance within the application, which leads to our next focus?
			<li><strong>Gamification</strong> – How might we offer a more gamified experience that resulted in users participating in more games and increasing their engagment with the product overall?</li>
		</ol>
	</div>

<div class="Container--text">
	<p><strong>1. Mobile</strong> – When picks are needed, an email is sent to the user. Roughly 60% of these emails were opened on phones. When I joined there was not a mobile experience. It was essential. This would allow users to easily interact with the product <strong>while</strong> watching the event they are a fan of.</p>

	<blockquote>“Although an iOS app was planned for the near future, we knew we needed to act more quickly. We decided to build a mobile-web experience using jQuery UI.”</blockquote>

<div class="Container--text">
	<p><strong>2. Daily Pick</strong> – The Daily Pick was created to give people a chance to compete in a game every day. It kept them coming back daily. The Daily Pick instantly resulted in a dramatic increase in daily active users. It was quick, it was easy and there was very little time or risk involved in playing. It also allowed us to introduce an even larger variety of events. Many of these events may not have been worthy of a season, or even could be, as they are limited in time and length, but could easily be featured for a day. We could then leverage these one-off events in our marketing efforts, to acquire new users to the app.</p>

		</a>
	</figure>


<div class="Container--text">
	<p><strong>3. Social Interactions</strong> – We had a strong prescence on Facebook. We need to leverage the social aspects of the application and encourage users to share and interact in the correct context. We focused on interactions between users: Following, comments and proudly sharing their results. Afterall, these are people with a shared interest. They are fans. They are invested. They are proud.</p>

		</a>
	</figure>

<div class="Container--text">
	<p><strong>4. Gamification</strong> – The most common frustration we heard from users was related to season timing. If a season had already been active for an extended period of time and a new user wanted to join and play, they had little to no chance of winning that season and obtaining the prize. This gave them very little incentive to join an already started event season. </p>
		
		<p><strong>To rectify this issue, we created a weighted reward system, based on the size of the game.</strong> Rather than receiving a fixed number of points per game, you were now awarded certain number of tokens that was dynamically calculated based on your performance and the number of people in the game. So, even if you joined late, you had the opportunity to do well and instantly climb the leaderboard.</p>

</div>

<div class="Container--text">
	<p>We also introduced another element to the gamification system: Rewards and XP. These rewards would extend from the game experience and into the overall Fantuition experience. Visiting, sharing, inviting, commenting and many other user actions could result in a reward. </p>

<h2 class="Work-section">WHAT WE LEARNED</h2>
	<p>Understand your user's context of use. This team had experience building web products. This product was built web-first. Based on its users and their context of use, it should have been mobile from the start.</p>
	<p>There was definitely a market for this product. People want to be connected to the things they are passionate about. This allowed them to feel a part of a community.</p>
	<p>What we didn't account for is the difficulty managing these games and events. There is more to be thought about when it comes to creating events and categories, scoring them and managing the questions and answers.</p>
</div>


<div class="Container--text">

<h2 class="Work-section">THE RESULT</h2>
	<p>These additions to the overall experience resulted in a dramatic increase in many of our KPIs. More importantly, qualitative feedback showed that the overall perception of Fanuition as a quick, fun prediction gaming experience was at an all time high. Fantuition was truly FUNtuition (BA DUM, CHING!).</p>
