<h2 class="Work-section">THE IDEA</h2>
<p>Although not a dancer (and it's very clear if you've ever seen me attempt), I've always been connected to friends and family passionate about dance. Throughout all these relationships I noticed a need in the community. There are countless mediums to connect people interested in other creative areas, whether it be art, music, modeling, etc.. However, nothing of quality exists for those in the dance community. This is a community filled with extrememly passionate, talented individuals that are constantly looking for inspiration. My hope is they would embrace a tool that allowed them to spread their love for the art of dance.</p>

<h2 class="Work-section">THE PROCESS</h2>
<h3 class="u-textCenter">Competitive Analysis</h3>
<p>I had already done extensive research in the past, but needed to verify there is a need in the market. I need to pinpoint what exists, what doesn't exist and what could be done better.</p>

<p>I created a <a href="http://dropbox.com/paper">Paper</a> document to organize my findings. I focused on many different areas that range from emotional impression, overall customer experience, onboarding, UX, user flows and market features.</p>

<h3 class="u-textCenter">USER RESEARCH â€“ PHASE 1</h3>
<p>Based on my competitive analysis, I can see there is clearly demand for the product. However, I still need to validate my assumptions with what I believe is my target market. Would they use a product like this? What would there specific goals be with a product like this? Exposure? Inspiration? Connections? Do they find it useful at all?</p>
<p>Because I'm a lone designer, working on a new startup, finding users available for research can be difficult, however, lucky for me, I had many connections to tap into. I was able to conduct eleven interviews. I put together some quick, paper prototypes to provide context and visual aids for the interviewees.</p>

<h3 class="u-textCenter">USER PERSONAS</h3>
<p>After the data was analyzed, this seemed like a good time to identify some <a hre="https://www.uxpin.com/studio/blog/ux-designers-5-minute-guide-lean-personas/">lean personas</a> I'd be designing for. I ended up creating four different personas. I will iterate on these as more research is conducted.</p>
