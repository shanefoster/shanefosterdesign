<p>DanceLinked is a social network aimed at connecting dancers from around the world, allowing them to showcase their skills, inspire others and discover new opportunities in the dance community.</p>
<p>The project was started by myself and a friend of mine. I am responsible for all UX, Visual Design and Front-end coding for the project.
