    <h2 class="Work-section">MY ROLE & RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>
    <p>I was the Lead Product Designer for our team-side web application. This team was mainly focused on user onboarding, conversion to paid, team management and any other monetization initiatives.</p>

	<ul class="list--callout">
		<li style="border-left:solid 4px #FF8E01;"><strong>The Team (for this initiative)</strong> – Senior PM, Product Designer (Me), three engineers and QA. </li>
		<li style="border-left:solid 4px #FF8E01;">Worked in conjunction with VP of Marketing and Marketing Designer as well, as the setup process was funneled from the marketing site.</li>
	</ul>

	
	<h2 class="Work-section">WHO ARE WE DESIGNING FOR?</h2>
	<p>We are designing for managers and coaches of teams that are often assigned the task of administering their team's roster.</p>

	<h2 class="Work-section">MEASURES OF SUCCESS</h2>
	<p>Using rollouts, click tracking and Optimizely A/B tests, we’d like to measure user growth and track metrics. A few of the metrics below:</p>
</div>

<div class="Grid u-">
	<div class="Grid-cell u-md-size1of2">
		<div class="box box--kpi">
			<h1>10%</h1>
			<p>Roster member growth increase MoM</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="Grid-cell u-md-size1of2">
		<div class="box box--kpi">
			<h1>20%</h1>
			<p>Add a team member in the set-up wizard</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="Grid-cell u-md-size1of2">
		<div class="box box--kpi">
			<h1>40%</h1>
			<p>New users added via the bulk roster upload</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="Grid-cell u-md-size1of2">
		<div class="box box--kpi">
			<h1>25%</h1>
			<p>Users add a coach or manager in the set up wizard</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<h2 class="Work-section">DISCOVERY</h2>
	<p>To provide a successful solution we must first understand how coaches are currently managing their teams. 
     <p>What do we already know about the manager experience? What do we not know?  </p>
      <p>What are their pain points? How can we help them reach their goals?</p>

	<p>I spoke with multiple coaches and managers on our platform to answer some of these questions.</p>

</div>


	<div class="Container--text">	
		<h2 class="Work-section">CURRENT APPROACH & PAIN POINTS</h2>
		<p>There really wasn't much to our current onboarding process. Users signed up and were directed to our "Dashboard", which contained very little useful information.</p>
		<p><strong>We had data that showed that teams that add at least one player and/or one coach/manager when signing up had a much better conversion rate than those that did not.</strong></p>
	    <p>Getting more people in exploring our product offering (hopefully) showed them the value we bring, and, thus, resulted in more buy-in across their team.</p>
		<p>We had also received feedback that many coaches split the cost of the team management, so it would be important to get all important team stakeholders involved as easily and early as possible.</p>

	<div class="Container--text">	
		<h2 class="Work-section">STEP 0 (1 is coming, don't you worry)</h2>
		<p>Analytics showed that a large number of users sign up via a mobile device. Our current login form was one long form that was not responsive. Step 0 was to simplify this form, removing only the necessary information, and make it responsive.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="Container--text">	
		<h2 class="Work-section">STEP 1 – ROSTER ADDITIONS</h2>
		<p>As mentioned earlier, we had concrete data that suggested teams that add at least one member to their roster when first signing up had a much higher conversion rate to a paid plan.</p>
		<p>We attempted to make that process as simple and easy as possible here.</p>

	<div class="Container--text">	
		<h2 class="Work-section">STEP 2 – MANAGER FOCUS</h2>
		<p>68% of paid teams have two managers listed on their roster.</p>
        <p>Based on our research, these are usually the primary decision makers as to whether they use TeamSnap and possibly pay for it.</p>
		<p>We chose a modal here to really encourage the user to focus and potentially add any other stakeholders.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="Container--text">	
		<h2 class="Work-section">STEP 3 – USER VALUE</h2>
		<p>Scheduling games is essential to seeing the value of TeamSnap and all of its features. </p>
        <p>Many features are reliant on a game being scheduled, so this is a crucial step in the flow</p>
        <p>One of our most popular features is Availability. Adding a game and seeing the value in this is a huge win for us.</p>
	</div>

		<figcaption>Scheduling a game allows users to see the value in many of our features</figcaption>

	<div class="Container--text">	
		<h2 class="Work-section">STEP 4 – BUSINESS VALUE</h2>
		<p>Gathering optional team data that is super valuable to the business. This data allows us to target teams and users via other business partners.
		<p> Many users mentioned really liking customizing their team pages, so we chose to include some team personalization settings to reinforce the emotional connection users have to their team. This connection would be reinforced upon first signing up.</p>

	<div class="Container--text">	
		<h2 class="Work-section">DASHBOARD OPPORTUNITY</h2>
		<p>The dashboard is now used as an opportunity to remind them to upload their team/roster, if they didn't do so.</p>
	</div>

	<figure class="Image">
		<img src="/assets/img/work/teamsnap/teamsnap-setup-dashboard.png" />
		<figcaption>One other small but important touch point to encourage adding team members</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<div class="Container--text">	
		<h2 class="Work-section">EMAIL OPPORTUNITY</h2>
		<p>For managers that didn’t end up adding any members initially, we have an opportunity to promote our bulk roster import via email.</p>
		<p><strong>We tested a few times to send this follow-up email. 24 hours after sign-up seemed to perform the best.</strong></p>
	</div>

	<figure class="Image">

		<figcaption>Follow-up email sent to managers to promote roster completion</figcaption>
	</figure>

	<div class="Container--text">	
		<h2 class="Work-section">USER TESTING</h2>
		<p>Based on our conversations with coaches, many of them mangae their rosters using spread sheets and CSV files. We needed a way to easily upload these files to TeamSnap to create a manager’s roster.</p>
		<p><strong>We tested a few times to send this follow-up email. 24 hours after sign-up seemed to perform the best.</strong></p>
	</div>

	<div class="Container--text">	
		<h2 class="Work-section">FINDINGS</h2>
		<p>Our assumption that vertical scrolling would be preferred and easier to comprehend, but user testing showed otherwise.</p>
		<p>Some of the wording was confusing when referring to columns in rosters and mapping. Use fields instead.</p>
	</div>

<div class="Container--text">
	<h2 class="Work-section">RESULTS</h2>
	<p>The results were very positive overall. We didn't see as many users adding team members in the new setup wizard as hoped, but did see great usage of our bulk uploads. Allowing the skipping of the setup flow may play a part in lower numbers during the setup flow.</p>

	<h2 class="Work-section">WHAT WE LEARNED</h2>
	<ul class="list--callout">
		<li style="border-left:solid 4px #FF8E01;">Allowing users to skip the flow was helpful. It allowed us to follow-up and investigate why users chose to do so and make improvements.</li>
		<li style="border-left:solid 4px #FF8E01;">The majority of leagues and associations provide spreadsheets to teams holding their roster information. Allowing bluk upload of this is very important.</li>
		<li style="border-left:solid 4px #FF8E01;">This was a multi-step process. We could have done a better job rolling pieces out in phases for tracking purposes.</li>
	</ul>
