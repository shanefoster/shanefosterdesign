<h2 class="Work-section">TEAM MANAGEMENT, MADE EASY</h2>
<p>TeamSnap is a team & group management app that makes organizing and communicating with your team a breeze. I first used TeamSnap in 2006 for a basketball team I was playing on (Shout out to 'Boom Goes the Dunkamite'!) and instantly fell in love with it, which I was I instantly jumped at the opportunity to come on board and design for it.</p>

<h2 class="Work-section">WINTER IS COMING</h2>
<p>Okay, maybe not Winter, but many "huuuuuuge" design upates are. When I arrived at TeamSnap, the design team was in its infancy. It was an exciting time to join. Mobile applications didn't yet exist. The web app hadn't had any major design updates (UX or Visual) in quite some time. As a small team, we got to come together and redesign the brand and product from the ground up.</p>

<p>Once we agreed on our visual language, we started to build a modular, component-based design system in Sketch as well as a hosted pattern library. The result was a framework that forced a consistent experience for our users from conception to feature release.</p>
