	<h2 class="Work-section">WHAT PROBLEM ARE WE TRYING TO SOLVE?</h2>
	<p>How might we redesign an application with loyal, passionate users that hasn’t been updated since its launch, seven years ago?</p>
</div>

    <h2 class="Work-section">MY ROLE & RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>
    <p><strong>The Team</strong> – Product Designer (Me) , Product Designer, in collaboration with the Marketing, Engineering and Design team. </p>
	<blockquote>I was responsible for choosing and implementing perceptual patterns for the redesign (more on that later). I also collaborated with another member of our design team to build a UI Kit, Pattern Library and modular front-end CSS framework for the redesign. </blockquote>
	
	<h2 class="Work-section">WHO ARE WE DESIGNING FOR?</h2>
	<p>This redesign was targeted at our web product for Teams (vs our web League product), initially. It would be rolled out to all 15,000,000 of our users over time.</p>

	<p>This redesign focuses on the beginnings of our design system at TeamSnap. Because of this, our internal teams are our users. The design and engineering teams will be our primary users when it comes to using the design system and our pattern library.</p>

	<h2 class="Work-section">MEASURES OF SUCCESS</h2>
	<p>The measures of success for this new feature will be: </p>
</div>

<div class="Grid u-">
	<div class="Grid-cell u-md-size1of2">
		<div class="box">
			<h2>30%</h2>
			<p>Reduce the time spent to complete the primary action for each page.</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="Grid-cell u-md-size1of2">
		<div class="box">
			<h2>50%</h2>
			<p>Reduce accessibility issues (using online validation tools)</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="Grid-cell u-md-size1of2">
		<div class="box">
			<h2>50%</h2>
			<p>Reduce time spent to build new features internally (may be more anecdotal)</p>
		</div>
	</div>
	<div class="Grid-cell u-md-size1of2">
		<div class="box">
			<h2>50%</h2>
			<p>Reduce page load with cleaner front-end code</p>

<div class="Container--text">
	<h2 class="Work-section">CURRENT APPROACH AND PAIN POINTS</h2>
	<p>"This tape will self-destruct in 3 seconds…” is what I expected to hear after being assigned what seemed to be the nearly impossible task of completely visually overhauling the user interface of our web app, go.teamsnap.com. You see, the visual aspects of the app had been more or less untouched for the past decade – a testament to a really great initial design. Because of this, many of our customers were very comfortable and familiar with the interface. Heavily altering it needed to be done very carefully, to keep all the teams running on TeamSnap operating smoothly.</p>

	<p>I started with an inventory audit. There was a lot of work to be done here. Our current web application had very little consistency in more ways than one. There was a lot of opportunity to improve here:</p>

	<ul>
		<li>Inconsistent Visual Hierarchy</li>
		<li>Inconsistent Vertical Rhythm</li>
		<li>Inconsistent Horizontal Grid</li>
		<li>Outdated and difficult to identify icons</li>
		<li>Inconsistent typography</li>
		<li>Inflexible code</li>
		<li>No modular component-based system</li>
		<li>Unacceptable accessibility standards</li>
		<li>Not mobile friendly</li>
	</ul>
</div>

</div>

	<div class="Container--text">	
		<p>Luckily for me, some of this work was already discussed and collaborated on between all members of our design team. We had recently released our new iOS and Android apps for the first time ever. The beginnings of some visual consistency were seen in these apps.</p>
		<blockquote>It was my job to determine how to translate this to our web app.</blockquote>

	<div class="Container--text">
		<h2 class="Work-section">PERCEPTUAL PATTERNS</h2>
		<p>Thanks to the efforts of our talented mobile team and the rest of the design team, we had a pretty solid default color palette. We had to extend this for the web. We have thousands of teams using TeamSnap, each of them with their own identity. We had a goal to white label the app to allow each team to customize colors to match their team colors.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="Container--text">
		<h3>COLORS</h3>
		<p>We still needed a default color theme though. After these colors were defined, a talented designer on our team wrote a SASS function to allow for easy scaling of the colors that didn’t affect the hue. It also allow for the easy switching of style sheets, which allowed teams to alter their app colors to match their teams’ identity. </p>
	</div>

<div class="u-textCenter">

</div>

	<div class="Container--text">
		<h3>TYPOGRAPHY</h3>
		<p>TeamSnap’s brand and voice has always been fun and whimsical. Because of this, we wanted to choose fonts and icons that reflect this.</p>
		<p>Rather than using the standard Arial system font on the web, I opted for a combination of the playful Museo Sans Rounded for large type.</p>
		<p>Open Sans was used for body fonts. </p>
	</div>

<div class="u-textCenter">
	<img class="Image" src="/assets/img/work/teamsnap/teamsnap-typography.png" />
</div>

	<div class="Container--text">
		<h3>ICONS</h3>
		<p>Symbolset’s rounded, solid font icons were chosen for font icons. The icons were accessible, well made and easily identifiable. Because of the large selection, it gave us a lot to work with within our UI. They also fit well with our brand, voice and tone.</p>
	</div>


<div class="u-textCenter">
	<img class="Image" src="/assets/img/work/teamsnap/teamsnap-icons.png" />
</div>

	<div class="Container--text">
		<h3>GRID</h3>
		<p>The vertical rhythm is in our current app was non existent. <strong>We decided on the popular 8px grid to rectify this. This creates a familiar and predictable experience for our users.</strong> This consistency goes a long way to improve the overall experience.</p>
		<p>Moreover, we implemented a flexible, responsive horizontal grid. For our first release, we didn’t plan on making it responsive, but wanted to be forward-thinking, since it’s something we’d most likely implement in the future. </p>
	</div>

</div>

	<div class="Container--text">
		<h2>FOCUSING ON THE FRONT-END</h2>
		<p>With many of these foundational patterns in place, I could start focusing on the front-end components with our other designer. We completely wrote all new CSS from the ground up. We used SASS to allow for cleaner CSS and more modular, extensible code. </p>
		<p>With this new and improved front-end code, I was able to build a pattern library for development team to access to see production-ready components. This resulted in a better experience for the end user as well as our teams building the products. It helped bridge the gap between design and engineering and created a more consistent experience within our products.</p>

</div>

	<div class="Container--text">
		<h2>USER TESTING VISUAL DESIGN</h2>
		<p>With our current users, we needed to be sure the new patterns introduced didn’t hinder their familiarity with the app and how to use it. </p>
		<p>We ran behavioral tests to measure the new interface. We ran first-click tests with new and existing users. This allowed us to see if the newly designed call-to-actions were as effective as our hypotheses. We asked users to complete normal usability tasks. We watched, we listened, we iterated based on task success. </p>
		<p>Initially, we weren’t concerned with a user’s perception of the visual design. However, we did receive and respond to feedback regarding colors, contrast and accessibility that resulted in improvements to the interface.</p>
		<p>When it came to start releasing the redesign to production, we did it in phases, always monitoring version A vs B to make sure we didn’t introduce new errors of inconsistencies.  </p>

		<h2>RESULTS</h2>
	</div>
	
<div class="u-textCenter">
	<img class="Image" src="/assets/img/work/teamsnap/teamsnap-redesign.png" />
</div>

	<div class="Container--text">

		<p><strong>We were able to reduce the time spent to complete the primary action on each page by roughly 30%</strong>. Although time spent initializing the action was much higher, due to a very clear primary call-to-action on within each feature, there was more work to do within each interaction. </p>
	</div>


	<div class="Container--text">
		<p><strong>We greatly improved accessibility site-wide</strong>. The site was more accessible for screen readers. It was more legible for users due to improved contrast and vertical rhythm. </p>
		<p>Cleaner more modular code resulted in a massive improvement in development time. It also resulted in smaller files sizes, fewer HTTP requests and faster page loads. Because the code was directly tied to our pattern library and design system, we were able to develop new features and products faster and with more consistency. </p>
		<p>We now have the ability to build shiny new requested features at an exponentially faster rate. The next step in TeamSnap’s evolution will take this look and feel to the next level, gradually changing not just how things appear but how they work. </p>
		<blockquote>We started small. We incrementally made updates while always gathering feedback from our teams and users along the way. Because of this, the responses from our users regarding the redesign was overwhelmingly positive.</blockquote>
