	<p>I'm guessing you already know what Stack Overflow is, but if you happen to not, here's a brief description: 

    <p>Stack Overflow is the largest, most trusted online community for developers to learn, share their programming knowledge, and build their careers.</p>
	<p><strong>While at Stack Overflow I was the lead designer</strong> for our <a href="http://stackoverflow.design" target="_blank">Stacks Design System</a>. I worked directly with an amazing team of three engineers and I loved every second of it. I also consistenly collaborated with the many stacks stakeholders as well as a design team of 15.</p>

	<p><strong>While at Stack Overflow I contributed or led the following initiatives:</strong></p>
	<ul>
		<li>Led and conducted all interviews and research for the system, making sure we focus on consumer pain points and making the greatest impact possible.</li>
		<li>Define a design system governance process resulting in less friction and an increase in contributions to the system.</li> 
		<li>Refactored and optimized numerous UI kit components resulting in increased designer efficiency and accelerated time to release.</li>
		<li>Created and implemented a strategy to introduce design tokens, leading to more consistency and flexibility across the system.</li>
		<li>Introduced a framework and process to define our product roadmap, which I owned.</li>
		<li>Started designing a dashboard for us to be more transparent in our work and be sure we were measuring our success.</li>
	</ul>
