	<h2 class="Work-section">WHAT PROBLEM ARE WE TRYING TO SOLVE AND WHY?</h2>
	<p>How might we increase public transportation ridership while helping local businesses in the area?</strong> 
	<p>We know many repeat riders pass the same local businesses in any given area. How can we levergae this data and incentivize them to visit these businesses?</p>
	<blockquote>moovel purchased a product called <a href="http://validated.co" target="_blank">Validated</a> that had attempted to implement this idea. Validated was a service that allowed merchants the ability to offer public transportation credits to customers that made purchases within their stores. It was my job to further research this idea, test new solutions and iterate on the idea.</blockquote>

	<h2 class="Work-section">MY ROLE & RESPONSIBILITIES</h2>
	<p><strong>The Team</strong> – VP of Product, Senior PM, Senior PD (Me), Product Designer, Senior Engineer, Sales Manager, and two Marketing Managers.</p>
	<ul>
  		<li><strong>UX Design and Research</strong> – I was responsible for all design related to the Merchant/Storefront experience. I was in constant collaboration with another designer from my team who worked on the Rider side of the product.</li>
  		<li><strong>Visual Design</strong> – Owned all visual styling, component creation and management of our design system.</li>
  	</ul>
</div>

<div class="Container--text">
	<h2 class="Work-section">WHO ARE WE DESIGNING FOR & WHY?</h2>
	<p>The entire experience encompasses both business owners as well as the riders of public transit. <strong>My focus was on the experience for merchants participating in the program that are offering rewards in their stores for riders taking public transit.</strong></p>

	<h2 class="Work-section">WHAT ASSUMPTIONS ARE WE TESTING?</h2>
	<p>We had two larger public transportation providers sign up for our pilot program to use this new product. This was going to be a joint effort between sales, marketing and product. Before we got ahead of ourselves, our Design Director, my partner designer and myself got together to really think about what the unknowns are for this product. We put together our Riskiets Assumptions Canvas so we can get an idea of what we should be testing:</p>

<div class="Container--text">
	<h2 class="Work-section">CURRENT APPROACH & PAIN POINTS</h2>
	<p>To get an idea of where we were with the actual product, I performed a UX Audit to see where things could be improved within the overall experience. I shared this in Figma to allow for the team to digest the ideas. These allowed for some quick wins for people using the current product, but also gave me some ideas about what we want to measure and test with the merchant experience.</p>

</figure>

<div class="Container--text">
	<p>After interviewing a few merchants that were already participating in the program, I was able to get a better idea of their goals as well as pain points. We had also run a small pilot free pilot program to gather more data about the program. I put together a list of questions to ask them regarding their experience with the pilot. </p>

	<h2 class="Work-section">RIDER EXPLORATION</h2>
	<p>Although my focus was on the merchant side of the product, it was important for me to understand the motivations of people riding public transportation. To do so, the entire design team took the streets for some good old fashioned guerilla research. We wanted to get an idea of why and how some of them are currently using public transit in their every days lives and if a program like this would be enticing to them.</p>

	<p class="u-spaceBottomNone"><strong>Key Takeaways</strong></p>
	<ul class="u-spaceTopNone">
		<li>There is a good deal of friction in the sign up process.</li>
		<li>The IA is a bit confusing.</li>
		<li>It's hard to make sense of the data and track the success of the program.</li>
		<li>Riders are hesitant to trust public transit providers with financial data.</li>
	</ul>

	<p><strong>Building a Foundation</strong></p>
	<p>Because this was a prodcut initially built by one developer, there was some work to do upfront regarding design assets and our approach. We didn't have time to build a mature design system, but we knew we needed to get something in place to allow for consistency and speedier development. </p>

	<h2 class="Work-section">Key Takeaway 1 – Merchant Onboarding</h2>
	<p>The current sign up process required four steps, one of which required finding and upload images of your business. The other required enter your billing information before you could even enter the app and review the product. I reduced this to one step.</p> 
	<p>I also added a value prop to the sign up page. Almost all the merchants I spoke to were drawn to the environmental impact of being a part of this program. They were proud to be helping cars on the road and thus help the environment.</p>

<div class="Container--text">
	<h2 class="Work-section">Key Takeaway 2 – IA is Confusing</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>There are multiple areas showcasing reporting data: the dashboard, perks history and reports.</li>
			<li>Billing and plan data is tied to an account. In talking with merchants, they said their data is tied to each store.</li>
			<li>Most merchants in the program have one location, but if they don't, make the distinction between them more clear.</li>
		</ul>

<div class="Container--text">
	<p>I consolidated reporting, as shown below. I also added a few filters to allow more refined control.</p> 
	<p>You can now easily switch between locations and have better context.</p>
	<p>Billing & Plans are now tied to a location. This gives a user more control with multiple locations. They can copy their billing info from a pervious location if they'd like to keep it the same.</p>

<div class="Container--text">
	<h2 class="Work-section">Key Takeaway 3 – Better Insights</h2>
		<p>The Dashboard provides little data to the merchant. Giving them a better understanding of the data could help them better optimize their campaigns.</p>
		<p>These are busy small business owners. Many mentioned wanting to check the status on their phone. They aren't often sitting at a desktop computer.</p>

	<h2 class="Work-section">MEASURING SUCCESS</h2>
		<p>To understand how these changes are performing, I put togehter some research templates to track progress. These are quantitative guidelines that allow us to distinctly measure an outcome.</p>

	<ul>
		<li><strong>Onboarding</strong>– We believe an 80% form completion rate (20% abandonment) will be achieved for merchants when signing-up using the online self-service portal.</li>
		<li><strong>Adoption</strong> – We believe that after 90 days of participation 70% of merchants will continue in the program, finding it valuable to their business.</li>
		<li><strong>Reporting</strong> – We believe an 80% of merchants surveyed will respond positively when asked about their ability to understand their business’ overall performance when participating in the program. </li>
		<li><strong>ROI</strong> – We believe merchants participating in the pilot will see at least 15-20 more transactions/month as a result of this program.</li>
		<li><strong>Engagement</strong> – We believe that 70% of merchants will login to the portal at least once a week to review their performance in the program. </li>
	</ul>

<div class="Container--text">
	<h2 class="Work-section"> WHAT WE LEARNED</h2>
	<p>Take the time to understand your users and their needs. Don't let the goals of the business completely overshadow them.</p>
	<p>Always set clearly defined measurable goals. We didn't do this in the pilot program before this. This data could have been extremely valuable.</p>
	<p>Not everyone understands the design process. Remember that, and really try and help to see the value in what you do.</p>
