	<h2 class="u-spaceBottomLg">A Little About Me</h2>
	<p>Over the past 13 years I‚Äôve worked as a Product Designer for multiple consumer and enterprise applications. I have a proven track record of taking a concept from ideation to a shippable product or feature. I have a great deal of experience producing quality deliverables across a range of disciplines.</p>

	<p>Due to my experiencwe, the last few years of my career have revolved around Design Systems and Design Operations. I spend my time helping design and engineering teams work more efficiently and consistently.</p>
	<p>I‚Äôm empathetic and I care. Whether it be for the user, or those I am working with, <strong>I pride myself on being kind, and most of all, fun to work with.</strong></p>
	
		<p>When I'm not designing, music is my focus and my biggest passion. I love to make and produce it.</p>
		<p>When not doing that, I'm usually watching some form of basketball. </p>
