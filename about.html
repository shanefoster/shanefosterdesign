	<h2>The Designer</h2>	
	<p>Over the past 10 years I’ve worked as a Product Designer for multiple consumer and enterprise applications. I have a proven track record of taking a concept from ideation to a shippable product or feature. I have a great deal of experience producing quality deliverables across a range of disciplines.</p>
	<p>I’m empathetic and I care. Whether it be for the user, or those I am working with, <strong>I pride myself on being kind, and most of all, fun to work with.</strong></p>

		<h2>The Ginger</h2>
		<p>When I'm not designing, music is my focus and my biggest passion. I love to make and produce it.</p>
		<p>When not doing that, I'm usually watching some form of basketball (Go Lakers! Go Ducks!). </p>
